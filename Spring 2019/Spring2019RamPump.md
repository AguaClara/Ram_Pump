**[Sidney: Hey Ram Pump! I'll be making comments on your report in these square brackets.]**

## Abstract
The AguaClara Vertical Ram Pump (ACVRP) is an innovation that will enable water to be pumped from lower elevations to higher elevations using the driving force of falling water. The ACVRP improves on a conventional ram pump design by increasing its space efficiency and decreasing its capital cost. Although a prototype has been built, it has not reached the target pumping efficiency. The goal of this semester is to optimize the ram pump efficiency by finding the necessary forces to open and close the valve at the ideal times.

**[Nice work! This is a very succinct abstract. An overall comment for the manual: Please remember to write in past tense as it would be someone in the ~future~ reading your final manual. Refer to Will's Technical Writing Presentation or our team's Grammar Guidelines on Confluence.]**

## Introduction

The purpose of a hydraulic ram pump is to pump water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation using only the energy of the falling water to drive the water up ([bin Mohammad Ali, 2011](https://www.scribd.com/doc/76535229/Hydraulic-Ramp-Pump-Hydram)). In an AguaClara plant, flow through a plant is driven solely by gravity, so treated water exits the plant at the lowest point of the plant. Thus, in order to fill chemical stock tanks with treated water at earlier stages, **[This phrase is confusing... what is at the earlier stages? I assume you mean the chemical stock tanks but this phrasing makes it seem like the treated water is at earlier stages. Consider removing.]** operators must carry up buckets of water from the outlet at the lowest point of the plant to manually fill tanks. The AguaClara Vertical Ram Pump (ACVRP) solves this issue by allowing treated water to be pumped from the outlet of the plant to where it is needed at higher elevations in the plant, all without using electricity ([Aggarwal & Guzman, 2016](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MweG0bsgG2-wM_mkK_DgwULPSPK1G7iB/view?usp=sharing)). **[It seems that the authors of the linked report are different from who is cited. Did you mean to cite a different report or did you confuse Juan & Priya with Luna, Chris, and Javier? :P]** In addition, this allows the treated water to be pumped for utilization in the plant's plumbing system, which includes the plant's sinks and toilets.

**Figure 1:** The treated water exits the stacked rapid sand filters in the basement ([Adelman et al., 2013](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EE.1943-7870.0000700)) and flows down to the ram pump.
The ram pump then pumps the treated water upwards to the chemical stock tanks.

Check your citations to make sure the authors match with the report linked.]**

</p>


The ACVRP is an innovation that improves upon the conventional ram pump by making it easier to fabricate and more cost efficient. Conventional ram pumps that were used in previous AguaClara plants required an additional tank to be built to collect the water discharged from the ram pump and return it to the distribution tank, adding to the capital cost of the plant. The tank was cumbersome, and it was difficult to incorporate the tank in the pipe gallery at the basement of the plant ([Project Description Ram Pump](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4uX_CjjWllurb4KftwjLmaFy6Au-42kGi5e5m47YEI/edit#)).  **[OMG üò± it's the grant proposal I worked on with Monroe]**

The ACVRP is an inline ram pump, which eliminates the need for a collection tank. The ideal design will be able to be easily installed in new plants as well as easily incorporated in previously built AguaClara plants. **[Minor, but you used easily here twice and it can sound unprofessional.]** The simple design will also make it easy to fabricate and repair, which will empower the community and advance sustainability. The hope is that the ACVRP will relieve some of the burden of the plant operators, which will further increase their pride in their role of providing safe water to their communities ([Project Description Ram Pump](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4uX_CjjWllurb4KftwjLmaFy6Au-42kGi5e5m47YEI/edit#)).

## Literature Review
Many water supply plants use electrically-powered ram pumps to redirect water from a lower to higher elevation (Figure 2).

**[Something's wrong with this figure as well... I'll stop commenting about the figures, but almost all of them are broken. Double check before submission that all figures are showing up in preview and Github.]**

**Figure 2:** Common ram pump systems include ‚Äú(a) the header tank, (b) the drive pipe, (c) the pump with impulse and delivery valves, (d) the air chamber and (e) the delivery pipe‚Äù (Young, 1995, p. 313).

</p>
**[It may be worthwhile to flesh out your explanation of what a conventional ram pump is and compare it to the ACVRP so that the reader knows why and how specifically the ACVRP is different/why it is important & innovative.]**
The past teams have adopted many of these elements of a traditional ram pump system and have been modifying this mechanism to satisfy the team‚Äôs gravity-powered water filtration design. The current AguaClara ram pump design consists of a plate attached to a rod loaded with a spring that opens and closes. The naturally open state of the plate allows for the water that flows down through the drive pipe to pass by the effluent pipe and goes into waste. When enough force from the water flowing through the drive pipe overcomes the spring force and the plate closes, the water is redirected up through the effluent pipe. Constantly alternating between these two states, open and closed, allows for the water to be pumped up (Figure 3).

**Figure 3:** Diagram of valve cycle from [Aggarwal et al., 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVIHr27h-mA25sROwWSHHzI-v0FXReoA/view). **[Fragment. Please change to a proper sentence.]** When the valve is open, the driving force of falling water pushes the valve closed. When the valve is closed, the spring force pushes the valve to open again.

</p>

The main concern of ACVRP is prolonging the time that the plate is closed to allow a higher volume of water to travel up through the effluent valve. **[This isn't a "concern of ACVRP" but a concern that the team has while working on developing the ACVRP.]** The Spring 2018 team worked on optimizing the output of water through the effluent pump by experimenting with springs that control the opening and closing of the plate. The energy efficiency of the ram pump was tested with a pulley system designed to calculate the minimum spring constant for the spring inside the pump. The current team is continuing the data collection of the force of water on the plate using a modified version of the pulley system from Fall 2019 **[Fall 2019 is in the future?!?! I can't believe we have time travellers on our team...üò±]** to find the most efficient spring constant. With the calculation of the most efficient spring constant, the team hopes to extend the time that the plate is closed throughout a long period in order to maximize the water flow up through the effluent valve. **[This is repetitive. You said the exact same thing in the first sentence. Could you explain more why the spring force matters in extending the time the plate is closed instead?]**

**[This entire paragraph seems like it would fit in Previous Work more.]**

## Previous Work
Previous teams worked on creating a mathematical model to calculate the necessary forces to open and close the check valve. **[I know what the check valve is, but the reader may not. Please define terms you use so it is clear to your audience.]** These forces dictate whether water entering the drive pipe exits at the bottom as waste or if it is driven through the effluent pipe. Once these forces are calculated, they can be used to design a toggle mechanism to open and close the check valve at optimal times that will maximize the efficiency of the pump. The current mechanism for doing this is by using a spring. **["The current mechanism for doing this is a spring." The mechanism is the spring not "by using a spring". Please revise this sentence so you don't end up saying "doing this" because you are using conversational lingo, which may seem unprofessional.]** Thus, by finding a spring with an ideal spring constant, a more efficient ram pump can be designed.

During the Spring 2018 semester, the team set up a system to find the forces empirically using a mass on a pulley to lift the valve open. **[Replace this sentence with the paragraph I noted would be better suited in the Previous Work section.]**

### Lab Setup

A lab apparatus was constructed to simulate conditions in an AguaClara plant (Figure 1, Figure 4). The electric sump pump, in red, provides a continuous source of water for the head tank. **[Please make it obvious to the reader that you are referring to Figure 4 (i.e. "The electric sump pump, in red in Figure 4...")]** The drive pump **[Did you mean the drive pipe? If so, please don't change naming conventions without explaining what is being referred to.]** is where falling water enters the ram pump, providing the driving energy needed for the ram pump to pump water up through the effluent valve. A pressure sensor located at the top of the sealed air chamber will allow for headloss measurements, which will indicate **[Consider changing to "which indicate" rather than "which will indicate".]** the efficiency of the ram pump. The headloss indicates how high the ram pump can pump water up. Water that exits the ram pump as "waste" is the treated water that would be returned to the distribution tank.

</p>

### Water Velocity in Drive Pipe

The opening and closing of the check valve should be timed precisely so that the maximum amount of water is pumped in each cycle, maximizing the area under the curve in the graph below (Figure 5). Previous research found under ideal conditions, the "terminal velocity of water in the drive pipe was 0.35 m/s" ([Aggarwal et al., 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVIHr27h-mA25sROwWSHHzI-v0FXReoA/view)) **[Fragment. Change to a proper sentence.]**. Thus, using this benchmark, the target maximum velocity to trigger the valve to close should be less than the terminal velocity because the water accelerates towards terminal velocity asymptotically. An arbitrary velocity of 1/2 the terminal velocity was chosen as the target ([Aggarwal et al., 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVIHr27h-mA25sROwWSHHzI-v0FXReoA/view)).

The red line shows the increasing velocity of the water in the drive pipe until it reaches its terminal velocity. The intersection of the red and blue lines indicate the point in time when the check valve closes, causing the water to decelerate rapidly.

</p>



### Force Analysis

The main forces to design for are: 1) the force to close the check valve and 2) the force to open the check valve.

The force to close the check valve is supplied by the force of the falling water in the drive pipe. The force to open the check valve is supplied by a spring. The spring force must be greater than the combined downward forces of the weight of the water in the drive pipe and the weight of the check valve plate.

The formula for spring force is given by:

$$F = -kx$$

where k is the spring constant, a material property of the spring, and x is the compression/elongation displacement of the spring. To find this x, the distance that the spring was compressed when the valve is closed, the Fall 2018 team measured the distance the plate moved. They found this to be 1.3 cm ([Storch and Snyder, 2018](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Fall%202018/Manual.md)).


### Finding Forces Empirically

The Fall 2019 **[Note the citing of a future team here as well.]** team ran experiments to find the force that the moving water in the drive pipe exerted on the plate when it was open. The team implemented a pulley system to find the force empirically. Since the valve has a unique geometry, the team found that it was easier to find the force through experimentation, and so the team threaded a string through the drive pipe and a pulley system as shown in figure 6. One end of the string was attached to the metal plate in the valve, while the other end was attached to a water bottle suspended in air on the other end of the pulley as a counterweight. The bottle was filled with water initially to keep the plate opened with the pump running, and after that, the water in the bottle was emptied gradually until the plate was not longer held opened. Since the point that the team would like to obtain was right before the plate was closed, the team then used a pipette to gradually add water back until the plate was held opened again. The weight of the bottle at this point was taken, and a simple force balance was applied to find the force:  $$F_{water}+W_{rod}=W_{bottle}$$ $$F_{water}=W_{bottle}-W_{rod}$$ where $W_{rod}$ is the weight of the plate and rod in water. **[I know you define the other two terms in the figure later on, but it would be good to define all terms in the equation here when they are first used.]**

**Figure 6:** Free body diagram of forces acting on the check valve in the ram pump from [Storch and Snyder, 2018](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Fall%202018/Manual.md).

- $W_{bottle}$ is the weight of the bottle, which is used to experimentally determine the force required to lift and open the check valve.
- T is the tension force of the pulley string
- $F_{water}$ is the force of falling water in the drive pipe

Thus, by finding the mass needed to keep the check valve open, $F_{water}$ can be solved for. This can be set equal to the spring force, $F = -kx$, which will allow the spring constant, k, to be solved for. This will give the optimal spring constant needed to keep the valve open. The Fall 2018 team found that the minimum spring constant (k) was 256 N/m.

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.

```python
import aguaclara.research.procoda_parser as pp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

time, influent_turbidity, effluent_turbidity = pp.get_data_by_time(
      path="Data", columns=[0, 3, 4], start_date="6-14-2018",
      start_time="15:40", end_time="23:30")
elapsed_time = (np.array(time)-time[0])*24

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.set_xlabel("Time (hours)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Effluent Turbidity (NTU)")
line1, = ax1.plot(elapsed_time, effluent_turbidity, color="blue")

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.set_ylabel("Influent Turbidity (NTU)")
ax2.set_ylim(60,120)
line2, = ax2.plot(elapsed_time, influent_turbidity, color="green")

plt.legend((line1, line2), ("Effluent", "Influent"))
plt.savefig("Turbidity.png")
```

</p>
<p align="center">
  Figure 3. Descriptive captions are very important for figures. Rather than including a title above your figure, write a caption below.
</p>

### Figure requirements
 - Create the graph using python (not Excel)
 - If the x axis is time then make zero time reflect the beginning of the test.
 - Use a white background for all graphs.
 - Most data will have both x and y values and thus should be presented using an xy scatter plot.
 - Label all axes and include units where appropriate.
 - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph and not inside the graph border.
 - Eliminate parts of the range in both x and y axis that aren't used or that aren't meaningful.
 - Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.
 - Use data symbols to show data points unless there is so much data that the symbols overlap. If the data symbols overlap it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.
 - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.
 - If curve fitting is used explain why and include the equation (elsewhere in the report).
 - If a model or theoretical curve is presented it should be a smooth curve without data points.
 - Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.
 - Insert the graph in your report after the first reference to it in the text. Inserted the graph after the next paragraph break
 - Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images because that causes the export to Microsoft Word option to not include the image.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work
Describe your plan of action for the next several weeks of research. Detail the next steps for this team. How can AguaClara use what you discovered for future projects? Your suggestions for challenges for future teams are most welcome. Should research in this area continue?
