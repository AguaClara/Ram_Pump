## Fabrication Details
The ram pump consists of two 1.5" threaded metal check valves connected by a custom PVC fitting. The upper check valve connects to the PVC drive pipe which provides the influent flow. The connection is made by a PVC male to male connector that screws into a male metal nipple and into the top check valve. See Figure 1 for exterior setup.

The interior of the ram pump consists of a threaded metal rod with two metal standoffs screwed on, and a hole in one end that has been tapped to accommodate a threaded metal plate. The spring fits into the interior by fitting concentrically over the end of the metal rod below the standoff. See Figure 2 for interior setup.

### Check Valve Inverted Configuration
The CEE machine shop is equipped to fabricate inverted valve. The inverted check valve consists of a standard metal check valve with the following modifications.
2. Drill a .25" diameter hole 2.4" up from the bottom of the valve and another .5" hole at the same elevation at the opposite side of the valve.
2. Both holes must then be tapped in order to accommodate threaded pipe fittings for the pressure test valve and the effluent valve.
3. Screw in the pressure test valve and the effluent valve.
4. Apply acrylic flex sealant tape around connection between threads and valve in order to ensure water tightness.

### PVC Fitting Fabrication

1. Purchase two 1" male connectors for which one side is threaded and the other is smooth.
2. Depending on length of rod and spring on interior of pump, use band saw to cut one connector so that both connectors together


## Special Components
If your subteam uses a particular part that is unique and you could foresee a future subteam needing to order it or learn more about it, please include basic information like the vendor where it was purchased, catalog/item number, and a link to any documentation.
1. Check valve
  * Order new check valves from McMaster Carr online store
  * Generally, check valves can be used from the previous year unless severely deformed or threading has degraded.
2. Metal plates
  * Metal plates can be reused from previous years.
  * However, if new plates need to be ordered they are generally only available with the purchase of a new check valve.
3. Springs
  * The team purchased spring of desired k constants from Home Depot in Ithaca, but most testing can be accomplished with springs purchased in previous semesters.


## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
Step 1.
* Put tasks in a sequential order.
* It is okay to have sub-lists.
  - Like this.

### Experiment
Step 1.
Assemble ram pump in the ordinary configuration as shown in the figure below.

Step 2.
Fill the waste water bucket roughly half way to the brim.

Step 3.
Connect a pressure sensor to the effluent outlet to measure the effluent pressure of the system using ProCoDA

Step 4.
Open the bucket connector valve and close the drive pipe valve.

Step 5.
Plug in the electric sum pump and allow it to run until all water is removed from the collection bucket and into the head tank.  Then close the bucket connector valve and unplug the pump.

Step 6.
Direct the effluent pipe into a separate container.  Open the drive pipe valve while starting a stopwatch at the same time.
Run the ram pump until roughly 30 seconds elapse.  Stop the timer and close the drive pipe valve simultaneously.

Step 7.
Measure the volume of water in the effluent and collection bucket underneath the drive pipe.  Divide each by the time measured to compute the flow rate of the effluent and waste streams.

Step 8.
Measure the length of the drive pipe and compute the effluent head by dividing the pressure measured from the sensor using ProCoDA by the density of water multiplied by the gravitational acceleration constant.

Step 9.
Repeat steps 1-8 using the inverted configuration of the ram pump.



### Cleaning Procedure
1. Run DI Water through the system
2. Close the valve to the sum pump while the water is running through to accumulate the water in the waste bucket
3. Drain the waste valve and remove all attached tubing
4. Run a 9:1 water to bleach solution through the tubing using a peristaltic pump
5. Allow the ram pump and PVC to air dry over night
6. Make sure there are no spills around the ram pump or on the lab station
7. Remove excess and unnecessary clutter from the lab station

## Experimental Checklist
1. Check that the water level in the waste water is above the outlet to the sum pump
2. Make sure every valve is set to open
3. Check that all the fittings are secured to prevent water leaks
4. Ensure that the spring and the rod are well aligned inside the valve
5. Make sure there is no water on the surface of the table when plugging in the sum pump
6. Check that the effluent flow valve is discharging into the container
7. Check that there are no obstructions in the tubing connected to the pressure sensor



## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\end{itemize}

### Set Points
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.



### Variables
$g$: gravity
$t$: time
$P$: pressure
$a$: amplitude
$h$: water depth
$H$: distance from tank to pump (2$a$)
$F$: force
