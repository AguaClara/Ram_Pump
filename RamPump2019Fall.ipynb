This semester the team plans to fabricate a new lab setup, to implement a redesign of the ACVRP, and to further explore ways to improve its efficiency. The team has decided on a new design and created a materials list for the new parts needed and is currently updated the CAD model to reflect the changes.

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of a hydraulic ram pump is to pump water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation using the kinetic energy of the falling water to drive the water upward [(bin Mohammad Ali, 2011)](https://www.scribd.com/doc/76535229/Hydraulic-Ramp-Pump-Hydram). An AguaClara plant's flow is driven solely by gravity, and all treated water exits the treatment process at the lowest point of the plant. In order to fill chemical stock tanks, located at the top, currently, many of the plant operators must manually fill buckets of treated water at the bottom of the plant and transport them to the most elevated section of the plant. The current elevation between where the ram pump is installed to the surface of the filtered water channel is approximately 2 meters, and the elevation from the surface to the top of the chemical stock tank is approximately 4 meters. The AguaClara Vertical Ram Pump (ACVRP) needs to be able to pump water to a minimum of 6 meters of head. This solves the issue of treated water needing to be manually transported up to the chemical stock tanks, and does so without the use of electricity [(Martinez et. al, 2016)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MweG0bsgG2-wM_mkK_DgwULPSPK1G7iB/view).\n",
        "\n",
        "The ACVRP is an innovation that would improve upon the conventional ram pump design by making installation easier and most cost-efficient for plant operators. Ram pumps used in previous AguaClara plants required an additional collection tank for water discharged from the ram pump in order to return expelled water to the distribution tank. The collection tank added capital cost to the plant and was difficult to incorporate into the pipe system of the basements of these plants. \n",
        "\n",
        "The ACVRP is an inline ram pump that eliminates the need for an additional collection tank and would be easily installed into new plants, as well as, previously built AguaClara plants. The design allows for easy fabrication and repair, and encourages communities to advance in their development of sustainable practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The updated design stations the adjustable parts of the mechanical ram pump closer to the more accessible areas of the plant. Instead of having the inline pump solely at the bottom of the plant, the entire mechanism will span from the bottom of the plant to the end of the water treatment process. This will spare workers the time and effort of traveling to the bottom of the plant, where there may not be lighting or optimal conditions to work in, and instead allow for any small adjustments of the pump to be made easier. One of the challenges this semester will be determining how to operate the ram pump through the drive pipe. It may be difficult to make precise calculations on how material going through the pipe may affect the water's velocity or how much force is transmitted to the bottom plate of the ram pump.\n",

        "## Literature Review and Previous Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous Ram Pump teams have been working towards establishing mathematical models to describe the ram pump's theoretical behavior, experimentally measuring forces within the ram pump to characterize it's actual behavior, and developing methods to calculate an ideal spring constant to optimize the ACVRP's efficiency as well as creating CAD models and modifying the experimental setup. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Procedure Changes\n",
        "The Spring 2019 team used ProCoDA to pressurize the air chamber to 6 m of head to simulate the elevation to which the ACVRP will be required to pump water to in an AguaClara plant [(Pang et. al. 2019)](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Spring%202019/Spring2019RamPump.pdf). This method was further developed by the Summer 2019 team by using PID controls to pump water out of the air chamber to keep the pressure constant [(Pang and Ju, 2019)](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Summer%202019/RamPump2019Summer.ipynb). \n",
        "\n",
        "### Design Updates\n",
        "The Summer 2019 team also modified the design of the ACVRP, effluent pipe, and air chamber. These changes were to decrease headloss, increase ease of assembly and disassembly, and to simulate an AguaClara plant as closely as possible. The CAD model of one of the iterations of the new design is shown in Figure 1 and the iterations of the air chamber including the most recent design are shown in Figure 2.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Spring Constant and Forces\n",
        "The Fall 2018 team placed heavy focus on finding the ideal spring constant [(Storch and Snyder, 2018)](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Fall%202018/Manual.md). The team took a new approach and used the following equation to find an ideal k value: $$k=\\frac{|F_{opening}-F_{closing}|}{\\Delta x}.$$ In this equation, $F_{opening}$ is the force at which the plate opens and $F_{closing}$ is the force at which the plate closes. The team assumed $F_{opening}$ to be the hydrostatic force of the water in the drive pipe since ideally the plate would open once the water decelerated completely, allowing the plate to remain closed for the longest period of time. However, $F_{closing}$ is more complicated and can not be calculated easily. Because of this, the team decided to take an experimental approach to finding this force. The experimental setup and procedure is described in [Storch and Snyder, 2018](https://github.com/AguaClara/ram_pump/blob/master/Fall%202018/Manual.md). \n",
        "\n",
        "The Spring 2019 team built off of this work and implemented the use of $k'$ in their force balance equations. They defined $k'$ as the given spring constant $k$ in N/m divided by the original length of the spring, $L$. Using $k'$ allows the team to cut a spring to alter it's spring constant while easily accounting for this change in their equations. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives\n",
        "This semester, the Ram Pump team aims to redesign the lab setup to be incorporated into the work bench in order to accomodate the relocation of the lab. Because of this, the height of the overhead bucket and a few pipe sizes are going to change. Additionally, the team is planning on redesigning the Ram Pump to only consist of one check valve whose plat is connected to an extension spring above the overhead bucket. While these changes mean much of the data from previous semesters is no longer applicable to the future setup and design, many of the experiments, code, and insights can still be used and will continue to be useful.
